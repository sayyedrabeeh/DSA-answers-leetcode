## ❓ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]

| Approach            | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Explanation                                |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force         | O(n²)           | O(1)             | Check every pair of elements               |
| Hash Map (Optimal)  | O(n)            | O(n)             | Store values in a map to find complement   |

## ✅ Optimal Approach Explanation

### Algorithm:

- Initialize an empty dictionary `seen` to store numbers and their indices.
- Iterate through the list.
- For each element, compute its complement with respect to the target (`target - element`).
- If the complement exists in `seen`, return the pair of indices.
- Otherwise, store the current number and its index in `seen`.

### Code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, j in enumerate(nums):
            c = target - j
            if c in seen:
                return [seen[c], i]
            seen[j] = i
```
